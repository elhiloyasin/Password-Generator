# Password-Generator

## Description
```
You ever feel like you created a password but still feel unsure about the password you created. Thats what this application is all about, I created it to make it easy to have a secure password with no guessing involved. It asks you questions to create a password that you may prefer. The questions include do you want letters, numbers or special characters to make a password that is based on your answers when prompted.
